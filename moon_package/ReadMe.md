### **Core Features**

1. **Transparent Token Launch**
   - Customize your token's data, including supply (not limited to 100 billion tokens).
   - Define your liquidity pool with flexible pair options (e.g., **SUI:<YourToken>**).
   - Implement safeguards against rug pulls:
     - Creators can only withdraw their initial investment **if no holders** exist besides the creator.
     - This ensures fairness and prevents malicious actors from draining liquidity once the token is in circulation.

2. **Easy Token Swapping**
   - Effortlessly swap your memecoins for other tokens with **one click**.
   - Leverage Mizu Moon's **auto-swap feature** to convert your current tokens to those you desire instantly.
   - For even more flexibility, Mizu Moon integrates with the **Cetus Network**, allowing swaps based on **real-time token valuations**.

we create an empty coin:: we then get metadata cap delivered to our address which then will rename the token to what the users wants it to be, we use the treasury cap to mint the tokens and we can then store that treasury cap for more minting or burning or even destroy the treasury cap. ____----- need to test this idea.
